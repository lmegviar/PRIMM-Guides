[]   1. Change the countdown value to start from 5 instead of 10 and print a different liftoff message.

[]   2. Modify the for loop to create a different pattern, such as a triangle or a square.

[]   3. Add user input so that the user must confirm they are ready to launch before the countdown begins.

[]   4. Use the continue statement inside the for loop to print only even numbers from 1 to 10.

[]   5. Create a new for loop to print a countdown pattern (like 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Blastoff!).

[]   6. Experiment with changing the pattern list to contain different symbols (e.g., '$', '#', '@').

[]   7. Modify the code to use a while loop to count from 1 to 15 and print only prime numbers.

[]   8. Add an 'else' block to the while loop to print a message after the rocket has blasted off.

[]   9. Create a for loop to print the pattern in reverse order.

[]   10. DESIGN YOUR OWN MOD! - Come up with a modification for the program.
